Our filler plant and controller can switch between liquids, 
however in the current implementation it is not selectable as we're currently working on connecting 
the POS and the controller.

Please Note: There is an additional gui tab. This should show a more visual view of what is happening, with less details around the signals. 
This tab still needs work and as a result if the controller is left in the “leavingPos5” state the green circle illustrating the 
bottle might move back and forth on the screen. This is only a visual bug. 
Pressing the enable button again should cause the circle to disappear until a new bottle is added and enabled is pressed again
